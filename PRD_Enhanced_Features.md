# DavidBot Enhanced Features PRD
## Version 2.0 Product Requirements Document

### Executive Summary

DavidBot v1.0 has successfully delivered basic worship song recommendations with Telegram integration and Ollama/Mistral LLM intelligence. This PRD defines the roadmap for v2.0, integrating new worship leader requirements while maintaining the ministry-focused value proposition. The enhanced system will provide comprehensive song management, intelligent filtering, and robust session context to serve worship leaders in live service preparation.

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** DavidBot v1.0 provides basic song recommendations but lacks critical worship leader functionality:
- No BPM-based filtering for tempo requests ("slow songs", "upbeat praise")  
- No key suggestions for male/female vocals
- Limited feedback mechanisms and no database editing capabilities
- Missing musical tag taxonomy separate from lyrical content
- Poor session memory and no recently recommended history
- No familiarity score management

**Future State:** A comprehensive worship preparation assistant that understands musical context, learns from feedback, and provides database management tools for ongoing ministry needs.

## Goals & Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1. **Enhanced Musical Intelligence**: 90% accuracy on tempo/BPM filtering requests
2. **Complete Feedback Loop**: Worship leaders can rate songs and edit database entries
3. **Session Context Mastery**: 60-minute rolling context with recommendation history
4. **Musical Tag Taxonomy**: Separate system for musical vs lyrical characteristics

### Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: 40% increase in follow-up queries per session
- **Recommendation Accuracy**: 85% positive feedback on tempo-filtered results
- **Database Quality**: 200+ songs with complete musical tag coverage
- **Session Effectiveness**: Average 8+ recommendations per worship leader session

### Guardrails
- **Ministry Focus**: All features must serve live worship preparation

## Feature Specifications

### Feature 1: BPM-Based Tempo Filtering

**User Story**: As a worship leader, I want to request "fast" or "slow" songs so that the bot returns appropriate tempo matches for the worship moment.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given user requests "slow songs on surrender"
- When bot processes request
- Then songs returned have BPM <80 
- And rationale includes "slow tempo match"
- And follow-up "slower" re-filters to BPM <65

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
class TempoFilter:
    TEMPO_RANGES = {
        "slow": (40, 80),
        "medium": (80, 120), 
        "fast": (120, 200)
    }
    
    def filter_by_tempo(self, songs: List[Song], tempo: str) -> List[Song]:
        min_bpm, max_bpm = self.TEMPO_RANGES[tempo]
        return [s for s in songs if min_bpm <= s.bpm <= max_bpm]
```

### Feature 2: Vocal Range Key Suggestions

**User Story**: As a worship leader, I want key suggestions for male/female vocals so I can select songs in appropriate ranges for my team.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given user specifies "male lead"
- When bot returns recommendations  
- Then BoyKey values are prioritized in suggested keys
- And rationale includes "optimized for male vocals"
- And fallback to OriginalKey if BoyKey missing

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
class KeySuggester:
    def suggest_key(self, song: Song, vocal_type: str) -> str:
        if vocal_type == "male" and song.boy_key:
            return song.boy_key
        elif vocal_type == "female" and song.girl_key:
            return song.girl_key
        return song.original_key
```

### Feature 3: Feedback Processing & Database Editing

**User Story**: As a worship leader, I want to rate songs and edit their information so the bot improves and maintains accurate data.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given user responds "üëç #2" to recommendation list
- When bot processes feedback
- Then familiarity score increases for song #2
- And positive feedback logged with context
- And future searches boost this song's ranking

**Database Editing Criteria**:
- Given user requests "edit song 'Amazing Grace'"  
- When bot shows current metadata
- Then user can modify tags, familiarity score, keys, BPM
- And changes persist to database
- And confirmation message displays updated values

### Feature 4: Musical Tags System

**User Story**: As a music director, I want to tag songs with musical characteristics separate from lyrical themes so recommendations consider both aspects.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given song has lyrical_tags ["surrender", "worship"] and musical_tags ["building_bridge", "6/8", "call_response"]
- When user searches "songs with building bridges"
- Then bot matches musical_tags for recommendation
- And rationale distinguishes musical vs lyrical matches

**Schema Enhancement**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE songs ADD COLUMN musical_tags TEXT;
-- Example: "building_bridge,6/8,call_response,key_change"
```

### Feature 5: Session Context & History

**User Story**: As a worship leader, I want to see what songs were recently recommended so I avoid repetition and track my session progress.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given user has received 12 recommendations in current session
- When user requests "show recent songs"
- Then bot displays last 10 recommendations with timestamps
- And excludes these from new searches unless explicitly requested
- And session context clears after 60 minutes

### Feature 6: Enhanced Familiarity Management  

**User Story**: As a music director, I want to bulk-edit familiarity scores so I can reflect actual congregation knowledge accurately.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given user requests "show songs with familiarity < 5"
- When bot lists low-familiarity songs
- Then user can bulk-update scores: "set familiarity 7 for songs 1,3,5"
- And changes reflect immediately in future recommendations

        self.session_manager = SessionManager()
    
    def recommend(self, query: str, user_id: str) -> List[Song]:
        # Parse tempo, vocal, and musical requirements
        context = self.parse_musical_context(query)
        session = self.session_manager.get_session(user_id)
        
        # Filter by musical criteria
        candidates = self.get_candidate_songs(query)
        candidates = self.tempo_filter.apply(candidates, context.tempo)
        candidates = self.exclude_recent(candidates, session)
        
        # Rank and suggest keys
        ranked = self.rank_by_relevance(candidates, context)
        for song in ranked:
            song.suggested_key = self.key_suggester.suggest_key(
                song, context.vocal_type
            )
            
        return ranked[:5]
