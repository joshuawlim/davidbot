## Sprint 1: Database and Integration for Analytics üóÑÔ∏è
**Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: Medium

### Goal
Integrate feedback loop from Telegram logs into davidbot.db database storage for user feedback and message logs, enabling better analytics and faster queries.

### Current State
- MessageLog and FeedbackEvent schema tables have been created
- Queries, outputs, and likes on DavidBot messages from Telegram aren't being stored in the underlying tables
- likes from DavidBot should add to familiarity score for songs

### Deliverables

#### 1.1 Enhanced Database Schema
- **MessageLog Table**: Store all user interactions with full context
  ```sql
  message_logs (
    log_id, timestamp, user_id, session_id, message_type,
    user_message, bot_response, context_keywords, songs_returned,
    error_occurred, processing_time_ms, created_at
  )
  ```

- **FeedbackEvent Table Enhancement**: Expand current user_feedback table
  ```sql
  user_feedback (
    feedback_id, timestamp, user_id, session_id, song_id,
    feedback_type, message_id, context_data, created_at
  )
  ```

#### 1.2 Database Tools
- Repository classes: `MessageLogRepository`, `FeedbackRepository`
- Database indexing for performance on analytics queries

#### 1.3 Analytics CLI Commands
```bash
# Usage analytics
python -m davidbot.manage analytics --period 30d
python -m davidbot.manage user-activity --user-id 123456

# Popular search terms
python -m davidbot.manage search-trends --top 10

# Error monitoring
python -m davidbot.manage errors --since yesterday
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A full query, response, and like on a recommendation is logged
- [ ] Analytics queries run <1 second on 10k+ records  
- [ ] CLI commands provide actionable insights

### Technical Approach
- SQLAlchemy models with proper relationships
- Batch processing for large data migrations  
- Background logging with error recovery
- Indexed queries for common analytics patterns

## Sprint 3: Enhanced Bot Intelligence ü§ñ
**Duration**: 5-7 days  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: Medium

### Goal
Explore use of an LLM or otherwise to add natural language processing and conversational intelligence to make DavidBot more intuitive and natural for users.

### Deliverables

#### 3.1 Natural Language Query Processing
- **Flexible Search Patterns**:
  ```
  "upbeat songs for celebration" ‚Üí BPM >120 + celebration tags
  "slow songs about grace" ‚Üí BPM <80 + grace theme
  "something like Goodness of God" ‚Üí similarity matching
  "songs we haven't used lately" ‚Üí low recent usage
  ```

- **Context Understanding**:
  - Understand relative terms: "faster," "slower," "similar"
  - Parse compound requests: "praise songs in G that aren't too long"
  - Handle typos and alternative spellings

#### 3.2 Conversational Context Awareness
- **Follow-up Processing**:
  ```
  User: "find songs on surrender" 
  Bot: [3 songs]
  User: "the second one was perfect"
  Bot: Understands reference to song #2, logs positive feedback
  ```

- **Session Memory**: Remember previous searches within session
- **Smart Suggestions**: "You might also like..." based on selections

#### 3.3 Advanced Filtering
- **Multi-criteria Search**:
  - BPM ranges with theme matching
  - Key signatures with familiarity thresholds
  - Exclude recently used songs automatically
  
- **Smart Defaults**:
  - Morning service: brighter keys, moderate BPM
  - Evening service: introspective themes, varied tempo
  - Altar call: surrender/response themes prioritized

#### 3.4 Worship Leader Personality
- **Context-Aware Responses**:
  - Urgent requests get quick, confident suggestions
  - Exploratory requests get detailed explanations
  - Error states provide helpful alternatives

- **Ministry-Focused Language**:
  - "For this season of worship..." 
  - "These songs invite response..."
  - "Perfect for altar call ministry..."

### Acceptance Criteria
